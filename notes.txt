R Data History Tool

Should start keeping history from when an analysis project is started.

Would be most simple to have for a single script.

When project starts nothing exists. There is state though, options and session.info

SHould be able to generate a script to recreate and object in the workspace.

Is there an R lint tool that would enforce code to look clean(ish)
